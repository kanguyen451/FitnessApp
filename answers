1. We choose ArrayList over Vector because...? 

ArrayList can be traversed through

2. Why enum instead of static?

enum allows us to have constants or string names of a variable

3. Why do we use a nested class?

Encapsulation and naming conventions

4. How do we get the name of an enumeration value?

.name() or .valueOf()

5.What is a try/catch block and why do we need one?
In case there is an error that is predictable,
we can insert a series of steps that the program takes in order to handle the error.

6.What is an exception?
An exception is a situation the program recognizes as an error and will act accordingly depending on
what the situation is.
